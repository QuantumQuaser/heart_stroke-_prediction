<a name="dataset-overview"></a>
## Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project contains various features related to health and personal attributes that might influence the likelihood of having a stroke. Key features include age, hypertension, heart disease, and more.

```python
# Sample Data Overview
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('path/to/stroke_dataset.csv')
data.head()
```

<a name="exploratory-data-analysis-eda"></a>
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA phase involves visualizing and understanding the distribution and relationships within the dataset.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Visualizing the distribution of 'age'
sns.histplot(data['age'], kde=True)
plt.show()

# Correlation heatmap
sns.heatmap(data.corr(), annot=True)
plt.show()
```

<a name="data-preprocessing"></a>
## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer

# Preprocessing steps
# (Add your preprocessing code here)
```

<a name="model-building"></a>
## Model Building
Various machine learning models are trained and tuned for the best performance.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

# Model building
model = RandomForestClassifier()
# (Add your model training code here)
```

<a name="model-evaluation"></a>
## Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated based on their performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Model evaluation
# (Add your model evaluation code here)
```

<a name="conclusion"></a>
## Conclusion
The project concludes with insights drawn from model evaluations and potential steps for further improvements.
